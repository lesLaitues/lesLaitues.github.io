# Short Story 00 — Space Punk

A brand-new spaceship underequipped “for style”, the engineer, the boss’ son, the young cook… going from space station K50 to X42. Will they reach their destination without getting lost in interstellar void? Is human society threatened from the outside or the inside?

(X42 is much larger than the ISS.)

A few weeks ago, I wrote [an article on the French version of this blog](/blog/2019/04/23/nvl00-space-punk.html), about this short story I have written in December 2018. Now, the story is translated in English. Actually, this blog has been dormant for quite a while now, and I hope that some science-fiction can be a good way to shake it awake.

During last November (2018), I participated in [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org/), the *National Novel Writing Month*. This event is a world-wide (not national) challenge to encourage people to write, likely a novel of at least **50,000** words, meaning you have to write 1,667 words a day during each of the 30 days of the month. My project was a fantasy novel, which did not benefit from the best story-planning there ever was. For now I call it *Un chant à la Lune*, French title that could be translated as *A song to the Moon*. Far from being an epic quest, it is merely the story of the son of a ghost, who then meets a fairy and her family, and who attempt to find their way in the kingdom of Reosal, society, and themselves; and survive. I think I prefer writing ordinary people, who feel more real.

However, even though this project had me busy for the whole month of November, even though I reached the 50,000-word goal, it is far from completion. Now this article is here to introduce a short story which is completed.

Written between 2 and 12 December 2018, this text is 14,700-word-long in English, just 300 more in French (strangely English is always shorter than French). That amounts to 26 A4 pages in 12pt. It narrates the journey of a small crew, on a short distance, from point A to point B. The focus was more on the characters and detail-building than the plot. The plot just needed to be consistent.

But I would be quite dishonest if I did not mention the importance of honorable **Johyn Papin**! It has been together, indeed, that the X42 universe was built. It happened in a RP (roleplay) internet conversation, in which we impersonated two android repairers. The fact that I did not create this world on my own makes it feel more real, more concrete. Johyn brought as much as I did if not more to the space station, and this short story is but an extension to it.

Well now, if you would follow Georges Felmort and his crew on their journey, I would be very glad.
