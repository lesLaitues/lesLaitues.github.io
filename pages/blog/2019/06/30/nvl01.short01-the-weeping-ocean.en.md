# Short Story 01 — The Weeping Ocean
“Once upon a time, on an island far away, there lived Love with the Ocean.”

Imagine waking up to the same lovely routine, every day, when unexpectedly, what you cherish most seems to leave.

This seven-page-long story was written between May and June 2019. It took a long time to write and so I hope you will be able to enjoy the result. As an experiment, and because I wanted this story to be read by an English speaker first, I wrote it in English and translated it in French afterwards, so the translation was in the other direction than [my first short story, Space Punk](/en/blog/2019/05/10/short00-space-punk.html). I think it was probably easier this way, but that might be because I was thinking half in my mother language, French, while I was writing in English.

Because I do not want to say much about the content of this short story here, I cannot mention the plot or the characters. I will only say I have tried to make this story *whimsical*, and that it is a story about Love.

The only possible issue, however, may be that with this, I did not intend to carry a meaning, a message. I was only attempting to write something beautiful in a sort of romantic/magical tale style.

Now that this is written, what next? We are expecting a new article by Johyn on his project NOISE (there was [a first article on it](/blog/2018/09/06/noise-partie-1-la-polyphonie.html), but only on the French version of this website u_u’). As for me, I will now try to write some test scenes and a plot for a novel! This has been in my computer folder, and now in my notebook, for a few months now. It would be the story of the *Mustaphe* family, living in France, in 2019. To make this more interesting, there will be questions of romance, following your dream and taking pictures of ruins, illegally. Currently the first would-be scene is being drafted, and I am eager to be done with it so I can gather some opinions on it.

Thanks for stopping by on **Laitues**, have a good read, and drop me an email by clicking my name in the sidebar or below, if you would like to.
