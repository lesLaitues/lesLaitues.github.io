# What do you think of lettuces?

You may have noticed, as of today a disruptive comments system has been added to [laitues.net](https://laitues.net). This system named [mozzarella](https://github.com/johynpapin/mozzarella) offers a commenting feature to resources on a static website. For instance, one generated with [tomato](https://github.com/ribacq/tomato).

## What's the point?

Commenting allows for example to give your opinion, to criticize or even to trash talk something. To prove this feature's usefulness, we have decided to launch a worldwide poll. This poll will have numerous societal repercussions. It is built around a double objective:

- Efficiency
- Transparency

The issue of this poll is nothing but the title of this article: "**What do you think of lettuces?**". We encourage you to react by commenting on this article directly. You may do that by using the form available below.
